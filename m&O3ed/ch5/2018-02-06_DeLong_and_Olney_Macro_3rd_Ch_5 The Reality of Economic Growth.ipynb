    "\n",
    "Real-world economies exhibit profound shifts in labor-force growth. The average woman in India today has only half the number of children that the average woman in India had only half a century ago. The U.S. labor force in the early eighteenth century grew at nearly 3 percent per year, doubling every 24 years. Today the U.S. labor force grows at 1 percent per year. Changes in the level of prosperity, changes in the freedom of migration, changes in the status of women that open up new categories of jobs to them (Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor could not get a private-sector legal job in San Francisco when she graduated from Stanford Law School even with her amazingly high class rank), changes in the average age of marriage or the availability of birth control that change fertility — all of these have powerful effects on economies’ rates of labor-force growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "What effects do such changes have on output per worker Y/L — on our mea  sure of material prosperity? The faster the growth rate of the labor force n, the lower will be the economy’s balanced-growth capital-output ratio s/(n + g - δ). Why? Because each new worker who joins the labor force must be equipped with enough capital to be productive and to, on average, match the productivity of his or her peers. The faster the rate of growth of the labor force, the larger the share of current investment that must go to equip new members of the labor force with the capital they need to be productive. Thus the lower will be the amount of invest  ment that can be devoted to building up the average ratio of capital to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sudden and permanent increase in the rate of growth of the labor force will lower the level of output per worker on the balanced-growth path. How large will the long-run change in the level of output be, relative to what would have hap  pened had labor-force growth not increased? It is straightforward to calculate if we know the other parameter values, as is shown in Box 4.7.\n",

    "The most frequent sources of shifts in the parameters of the Solow growth model are shifts in the economy’s saving-investment rate. The rise of politicians eager to promise goodies — whether new spending programs or tax cuts — to voters induces large government budget deficits, which can be a persistent drag on an economy’s saving rate and its rate of capital accumulation. Foreigners become alternately overoptimistic and overpessimistic about the value of investing in our country, and\n",

The higher the share of national product devoted to saving and gross investment — the higher is s — the higher will be the economy’s balanced-growth capital-output ratio s/(n + g + 5). Why? Because more investment increases the amount of new capital that can be devoted to building up the average ratio of cap  ital to output. Double the share of national product spent on gross investment, and you will find that you have doubled the economy’s capital intensity, or its average ratio of capital to output.\n",

    "One way to think about this is that the equilibrium is the point at which the economy’s investment effort and its investment requirements are in balance. Invest  ment effort is simply s, the share of total output devoted to saving and investment. Investment requirements are the amount of new capital needed to replace depre  ciated and worn-out machines and buildings, plus the amount needed to equip new workers who increase the labor force, plus the amount needed to keep the stock of tools and machines at the disposal of workers increasing at the same rate as the efficiency of their labor.
