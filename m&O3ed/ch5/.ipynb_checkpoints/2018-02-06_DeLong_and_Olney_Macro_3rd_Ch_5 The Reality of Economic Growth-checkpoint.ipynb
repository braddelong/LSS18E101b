    "Taking what we know and what we guess about the economy from back in the deep mists of time up to today produces a picture like that of Table 5.1. The numbers in Table 5.1 are—save for the past century — guesses, and they are — save for the past three centuries—extremely shaky guesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, they do tell a coherent and consistent story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century began in Britain — until 1800 or so — the human population of the world grew only as rapidly as a glacier moves. Population growth between 5000 BC and AD 1800 averaged less than one-tenth of a percent per year. Nevertheless, the cumulative magnitude of popu  lation growth was impressive; over a long-enough time span even glaciers can move very far, and 7,000 years is a long time indeed. Preindustrial population growth carried the number of human beings alive on this planet from perhaps 5 million in 5000 BC to 900 million in AD 1800.\n",
    "\n",
    "The glacial pace of human population growth before the Industrial Revolution was accompanied by complete or near-complete stagnation in median standards of living. Up until 1500, as best we can tell, there had been next to no growth in the material standard of living of the typical human for millennia. Even in 1800 the average human had a material standard of living (and an economic productivity level) at best twice that of the average human in the year 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was not that there was no technological progress. There was. Humans have long been ingenious. Warrior, priestly, and bureaucratic elites in 1500 or 1800 lived much better than their counterparts in previous millennia had lived. But just because the ruling elite lived better does not mean that other people lived any better. From 4000 BC to at least AD 1500, the typical life expectancy at birth was low (less than 30 years), and the typical adult human was short (5 feet, 4 inches or less, due to chronic undernutrition), lost his or her teeth early (although for him sugar was still a great luxury, George Washington needed false teeth because he was calcium-deprived and his body sacrificed the teeth to main  tain the bones), and ate a remarkably monotonous diet (rations for the Roman legions in AD 1 consisted of two pounds of bread per soldier per day, plus salt, plus a pint or two of wine, plus “garnishes”; rations for the British navy in 1800 were worse — save that the liquor was stronger, and the diet was supplemented by wee  vils in the crackers and enough fruit and vegetables to fight off scurvy).\n",
    "Only after 1800 do we see large, sustained increases in worldwide standards of living. Worldwide, output per capita grew at perhaps 0.15 percent per year between 1500 and 1800. It grew at roughly 1 percent per year worldwide between 1800 and 1900. And, as Table 5.1 implies, material output per capita has grown at an aver  age pace of roughly 2 percent per year, worldwide, since 1900.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is after 1800 that we also see extraordinary growth in human numbers, as the population explosion depicted in Figure 5.1 took hold. The population explosion car  ried the total world population to 6 billion before the year 2000. Population growth on a world scale accelerated from a rate of 0.2 percent per year between 1500 and 1800, to 0.6 percent per year between 1800 and 1900, to 0.9 percent per year between 1900 and 1950, and 1.9 percent per year between 1950 and 1975 before the first slow  ing of the global rate of population growth — 1.6 percent per year from 1975 to 2000.\n",

    "where, you recall, a: is a parameter that tells us how fast diminishing returns to investment set in.\n",
    "We also saw that in the long run each economy’s capital intensity K/Y tended to approach some equilibrium value and then stay there. Sustained growth in out  put per worker must be driven by sustained increases in the efficiency of labor. So the question, “Why no sustained increases in productivity?” is the same as the question, “Why didn’t the efficiency of labor grow?”\n",
    "The answer is that the efficiency of labor depends not just on the storehouse of physical and organizational technologies at workers’ disposal, but also on the natural resources available to the average worker. In modern times our skills at handling materials are so great that natural resources play only a small role: Soil bad? Dump some nitrogen on it. Plants too dry? Pipe water in from 300 miles away to irrigate them. Technology and capital make natural resource scarcity a much less important phenomenon now than in the past. But back before the Industrial Revolution natural resources and their scarcity played a very important\n",
    "\n",
    " role. It is no accident that for most of recorded history humanity has lived pri  marily in the great river valleys of the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus, the Ganges, the Yangtze, and the Yellow River — good silt and regular supplies of water were that important.\n",
    "Before the Industrial Revolution, as human populations grew, the stocks of known natural resources had to be divided among more and more people. Miners had to exploit lower quality metal ores, and farmers had to farm lesser quality agri  cultural land. Over time, overcut forests vanished. Where today are the cedars of Lebanon? Over time, land that had been irrigated too long and seen too much water evaporate in the hot summer sun became poisoned with salt. What we call the northern deserts of the Middle East were once called the “Fertile Crescent” and were the home to at least a third of humanity’s farmers. The net effect of resource scarcity and human fertility was that, in spite of technological progress, the world average efficiency of labor was little, if any, greater in AD 1500 than in 1500 BC.\n",
    "The idea that increases in technological capability induce increases in fertility that inevitably run into natural resource scarcity is one of the oldest ideas in eco  nomics. It was introduced early, before the end of the eighteenth century, by Thomas R. Malthus, who became the first academic professor of economics ever (Adam Smith had been a professor of moral philosophy) at the East India Com  pany’s Haileybury College.\n",
    "Malthus saw a world in which inventions and higher living standards led to increases in the rate of population growth. With higher living standards there were more pregnancies and more pregnancies were successfully carried to term. Better nourished children (and adults) had a better chance of resisting diseases. More  over, when incomes were high, new farmsteads were relatively plentiful, and get  ting the permission of one’s father or elder brother to marry was easier. For these reasons — both social and biological — before 1800 a higher standard of living inevitably led to a faster rate of population growth. The faster rate of population growth increased the scarcity of natural resources, and so lowered productivity. After a burst of invention, population would rise and resource scarcity increase until once again people were so poor and malnourished that population growth was back at roughly zero — to less than one-tenth of one percent per year char  acteristic of the preindustrial age.\n",
    "UNDERSTANDING THE ECONOMY BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL\n",

    "In the models of Chapter 4, we identified the efficiency of labor with “technology” broadly understood: the storehouse of techniques for manipulating matter and forms of social organization that we can use to boost the productivity of the aver  age worker. Before the Industrial Revolution humans were certainly inventive. “Technology” broadly understood improved to a remarkable degree in the millen  nia before 1800. So why were there no improvements in the efficiency of labor?\n",
    "Because the model of Chapter 4 made a shortcut. We lumped the effect of nat  ural resources on production into the efficiency of labor E. And before the Indus  trial Revolution, depletion of natural resources typically offset the beneficial effects of technological improvement. So the net effect was no improvement in the effi  ciency of labor: a constant value of E.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whether Malthus saw clearly what was in the past or not, he would have been astonished by what we have seen of his future. We do not live in a Malthusian age. For at least 200 years improvements in the efficiency of labor made possible by new technologies and better organizations have not been neutralized by natu  ral resource scarcity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a Malthusian age may return. Suppose that population in the twenty- first and twenty-second centuries grows as fast as population did in the twentieth century, when it grew at an average rate of 1.33 percent per year. The rule of 72 tells us that a population growing at 1.33 percent per year doubles in 72/1.33 = 54 years. Two hundred years is time for 3.7 doublings, enough time to multiply population about 14-fold. Take the year-2000 estimated population of 6.125 billion, multiply it by 14, and get about 86. If population grows at its twentieth-century average rate for the next two centuries, there will be nearly 90 billion people on Earth in 2200.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely, should such a population increase come to pass, resource scarcity would once again be a dominant feature of our world. For the past two centuries we econ  omists have been justified in writing down production functions in which the lim  ited supply of natural resources plays only a small part in the determination of productivity and production on a global scale. In a world with a population of 90 billion, we would probably not be justified in doing so. We would have to place more stress on the insights of Malthus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is much more likely that the age of the population explosion is almost over. Current United Nations projections forecast a rise in world population from a bit over 6 billion today to around 10 billion by 2050, and there population increase may well stop. Even in a country like India today, fertility is only a little above two children per potential mother. And in a wide section of the rich world from Japan to Italy, the average woman has fewer than two children in her lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "What caused the end of the Malthusian age? How did humanity escape from the trap in which invention and ingenuity increased the numbers but not the mate  rial well-being of humans?\n",
    "The key is that even in the Malthusian age the pace at which inventions occurred increased steadily. First of all, the population grew. Inventions made communication easier; especially after the invention of printing, knowledge could spread widely and quickly. More people meant more inventions: Two heads are better than one. The rate of technological progress slowly increased over the millennia. By about 1500 technological progress passed the point at which it could offset increased scarcity of natural resources due to population growth. Sustained increases not just in popula  tion but in the productivity of labor followed. As real incomes and standards of liv  ing showed sustained growth, what we call the demographic transition began.\n",

But the Industrial Rev  olution was not just a burst of inventions. It was an economic transformation that revolutionized the process of invention as well. Since 1850 the pace of invention and innovation has further accelerated: steel making, the internal combustion engine, pasteurization, the typewriter, the cash register, the telephone, the auto  mobile, the radio, the airplane, the tank, the limited-access highway, the photo  copier, the computer, the pacemaker, nuclear weapons, superconductivity, genetic fingerprinting, and the human genome map.

    " Yet it is important to recognize that the gulf that separates us in the world econ  omy’s industrial core from the citizens of Industrial Revolution Britain is much greater than the gulf that separated Britain in 1800 from medieval or ancient peas  ants and nobles. Economic historian N. E R. Crafts calculated that 10 modern-day automobiles have more horsepower than all the steam engines of Britain in 1800, and the vehicles of Berkeley, California, today have more horsepower than the steam power of Britain in 1870. Growth during the Industrial Revolution was, by our standards, very slow. And the people who lived through the Industrial Revolution were very poor.

    "The fact that Britain was the center of the Industrial Revolution meant that for a century, from 1800 to 1900, British levels of industrial productivity and British standards of living were the highest in the world. It also meant that English (rather than Hindi, Mandarin, French, or Spanish) became the world’s de facto second lan  guage.

    "Before 1500 human material standards of living and productivity levels rose at per  haps 0.01 percent per year. Between 1500 and 1800 they rose faster in the areas that were to become the industrial core of the modern world economy — first north  western Europe and then northwestern Europe’s settler colonies in North America — rising at a rate of perhaps 0.2 percent per year. The first half of the nineteenth cen  tury saw leading-edge economies’ levels of productivity rise at about 0.5 percent per year, and the second half of the century saw productivity accelerate still further.\n",
    "American Long-Run Growth, 1800-1973\n",
    "The Pace of Economic Growth\n",
    "Let us focus on the pace of long-run growth in what has been the world’s leading- edge economy for the past 100 years: the United States. Growth in the years before and after the Civil War was faster than it had been in the first half of the nine  teenth century. It accelerated still further as a second wave of industrialization took hold, fueled by new inventions and innovations such as steel making, organic chemicals manufacture, oil extraction, the internal combustion engine, pasteuriza  tion, the typewriter, the cash register, and the telephone. The accelerated pace of invention and economic growth has been maintained ever since.\n",
    "Late-nineteenth-century total factor productivity growth was, by our standards, relatively slow: at most 1 percent per year. But the capital-output ratio increased\n",
    "\n",
    " mightily as America ceased being a country of riverboats and blacksmiths and became a country of railroads and steel mills. Once the railroads were built, the possibility of supplying an entire continental market from a large factory induced the entre  preneurs and robber barons (or is that “industrial statesmen”?) of what Mark Twain called America’s Gilded Age to borrow and invest. On the other side of the capital market three important factors greased the skids and made it easy for Americans to boost their savings: the development of larger and better banks, the growing use and acceptability of bonds and other securities as forms of wealth, and the development of investment banking houses like Peabody-Morgan and then J. P. Morgan to make a market by assuring business investors that the financing for expansion would be there and assuring savers that their money would not be stolen.1 Similar patterns of growth in labor productivity driven for a couple of generations by the mobilization of savings and a resulting increase in the capital-output ratio have been seen in other times and places: Germany before World Wars I and II, Japan from 1900 to 1970, and the rest of east Asia in the years since World War II.\n",
    "But, as Chapter 4 argued, eventually the capital-output ratio reaches an equi  librium value, no matter how large the boost to the national saving-investment rate. And further growth depends not on increasing capital intensity but on increases in the efficiency of labor: education, invention, and reorganization.\n",
    "Throughout the nineteenth century and the first three-quarters of the twentieth cen  tury the measured pace of productivity growth continued to accelerate. The measured growth rate of output per worker rose from perhaps 0.5 percent per year between 1800 and 1870 to about 1.5 percent per year between 1870 and today. Growth has not been steady over that 135-year period. The growth rate was about 1.6 percent per year between 1870 and 1929 (the eve of the Great Depression), as is shown in Figure 5.5. Growth slowed slighdy during the Great Depression and World War II decades — a measured growth rate of 1.4 percent per year from 1929 to 1950. But then it acceler  ated: The growth rate of output per worker between 1950 and 1973 in the United States was 2.1 percent per year. Next to none of the growth since 1929 was the result of increases in KJY. Almost all of it was the result of increases in the efficiency of labor E. At least, that is what our best estimates of long-run economic growth tell us.\n",
    "But should we believe what our best official and semiofficial estimates tell us? Perhaps not. Many economists believe that official estimates overstate inflation and understate real economic growth by 1 percent per year, in large part because national income accountants have a very hard time valuing the boost to produc  tivity and standards of living generated by the invention of new goods and serv  ices. This was the conclusion reached by a blue-ribbon commission on consumer price measurement in the 1990s that was chaired by Stanford economist Michael Boskin. It is indeed very likely that true output-per-worker growth since 1870 has been even faster than our official statistics tell us. So for the average rate of output- per-worker growth in the United States since 1870, perhaps we should be think  ing not of 1.5 percent per year, but rather of 2 to 2.5 percent per year.\n",
    "Small differences in growth rates compounded over long periods of time make a huge difference. If Michael Boskin and his committee members are right (as we believe that they are), then those of us living in the United States today have a level of productivity — a material standard of living — somewhere between 14 and\n",

    "Modern economic growth is also a shift in the kinds of things we do at work and play — in the way that we live. In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War per  haps half of all Americans were farmers. Today less than 2 percent of American workers are farmers and farm laborers; there are more gardeners, groundskeepers, and growers and maintainers of ornamental plants in the United States today than there are food-growing farmers and farm laborers. In the second half of the nine  teenth century Americans traveled by foot, horse, wagon, train, and riverboat; at the end of the twentieth century, they traveled by foot (rarely), bicycle (rarely), automobile, bus, train, boat, and plane. Most Americans in the second half of the nineteenth century were literate, but very few had finished anything equivalent to today’s high school. Modern economic growth is the large-scale shift of employ  ment from agriculture to manufacturing and now to services. And it is the cre  ation of large business organizations. At the start of the nineteenth century, a busi  ness with 100 people was a very large organization for its time.\n",

    "America's Edge\n",
    "Between approximately 1890 and 1930, or perhaps 1890 and 1950, a host of inno  vative technologies and business practices were adopted in the United States. Euro  peans speak of “Fordism”: taking the part — Henry Ford’s assembly lines in Detroit and his mass production of the Model-T Ford — for the whole. The fact that other industrial economies were unable to fully adopt American technologies of mass production and mass distribution in the first half of the twentieth century gave the United States a unique level of industrial dominance and technological leadership in the years after 1950.\n",
    "This acceleration in American economic growth that placed America ahead of the rest of the industrialized countries seems, in the framework of Chapter 4, to have had two components. The first was a rise in America’s investment effort pro  pelled in part by the fact that more capital-intensive production processes — processes with a higher capital-output ratio — seemed more likely to be profitable in America, where you were serving a continent-sized market, than in Europe, where tariffs, language barriers, and other impediments to trade kept most pro  duction local and national. At some point in the late nineteenth and early twenti  eth centuries the American economy underwent what the late Stanford economist Moses Abramovitz and his colleague Paul David called a “great traverse” to a more capital-intensive growth path. This drive to a more capital-intensive growth path was also propelled, as Gavin Wright (yet a third Stanford economist) pointed out, by the extraordinary richness of the natural resource deposits discovered as the American continent was surveyed in the late nineteenth century.\n",
    "The second component is the turn-of-the-last century acceleration in the rate of growth of the efficiency of labor, which in turn comes from two sources: the cre  ation of the managerial and organizational structure of the modern corporation, on the one hand, and the routinization and industrialization of science and technol  ogy, on the other. When businesses began to spend serious money on their own research and development laboratories, the pace of technological innovation and thus of growth in the efficiency of labor sped up.\n",
    "Why couldn’t Great Britain, or the other industrial countries, maintain their lead or even keep up? Why was the twentieth century economically — and therefore also politically — an American century? Why didn’t western Europe have its own Henry Ford, its own industrial R&D labs, and so forth?\n",
    "Four factors appear to explain America’s position at the leading edge of tech  nology in the world economy throughout the twentieth century:\n",
    "• The United States had an exceptional commitment to education — to school \n",
    "ing everyone (everyone who was white, that is; and boys more than girls) even in the largely rural economy of the nineteenth century and to making the achievement of a high school diploma the rule rather than the exception in the cities of the early twentieth century. An exceptionally educated work  force was the source of new ideas about how to make a better mousetrap, and it could quickly copy and adapt others’ ideas as well.\n",
    "• The United States was of extraordinarily large size — the largest market in the world. Thus the nation could take advantage of potential economies of scale in ways that other, smaller economies could not match. And this mattered for capital intensity.\n",
    "• The United States was extraordinarily rich in natural resources, particularly energy. To the extent that energy-intensive and natural resource-intensive\n",
    "\n",
    " industries were at the heart of early-twentieth-century industrial growth, the United States was again well positioned. By contrast, western Europe had been mined over and logged for at least a millennium.\n",
    "• The United States avoided fratricide. Europeans killed each other and destroyed each other’s buildings and factories (and we helped) at a historically unprecedented rate in the first half of the twentieth century. Your chances of meeting a violent or unnatural death in Europe between 1914 and 1945 were greater than in any other generation we know of except perhaps for those in the paths of the armies of Genghis Khan.\n",
    "In the long run, however, western Europe did catch up to the United States. There is little difference in standards of living and productivity levels between western Europe and the United States today. Americans have somewhat more things and bigger houses but work longer hours and have fewer public services; Europeans have longer vacations and better public transportation but fewer opportunities to work and a harder time living in the suburbs.\n",
    "Up until 1973, with the important exception of the Great Depression, the picture of American economic growth since the Industrial Revolution seemed to be one of increasing progress at an increasing rate. The rate of increase in the efficiency of labor had jumped upward with the original Industrial Revolution, and it had jumped upward again with the coming of modem science and technology and the industrial R&D laboratory. The capital intensity of the economy had increased as businesses had sought to exploit the continent-sized market by grasping for economies of scale.\n",
    "But then came 1973, and American economic growth hit a large speed bump.\n",
    "American Economic Growth 1973-1995: The Productivity Growth Slowdown\n",
    "In 1973 the steady trend of climbing rates of productivity growth stopped cold. Between 1950 and 1973 the rate of labor productivity growth in the United States was 2.1 percent per year. Between 1973 and 1995 measured growth in output per worker in the U.S. economy grew at only 0.6 percent per year. The slowdown did not affect the U.S. economy alone: It hit — to different degrees and with different effects — the other major economies of the world’s industrial core in western Europe, Japan, and Canada as well (see Table 5.3 on page 134).\n",
    "What caused the productivity growth slowdown? Various observers at different times have attributed this slowdown in the growth rate of productivity to four dif  ferent factors: increased problems of economic measurement, environmental pro  tection expenditures, the baby boom, and oil prices.\n",
    "The first two of these are really the same thing. The argument that the pro  ductivity growth slowdown can be explained by expenditures on environmental protection is a branch of the “problems-of-measurement” argument, and it is by far the most important branch of that argument. When the price of electricity goes up because power companies switch to burning higher priced low-sulfur coal or install sulfur-removing scrubbers in their chimneys, they are producing not just electric power but electric power plus cleaner air. But the NIPA does not count pollution reduction as a valued economic output. America has spent a fortune on environmental protection in the past generation, and it has received big benefits from this investment. But these gains aren’t included in measured GDP.\n",

    "that this can be the full rather than a partial and relatively small part of the expla  nation is difficult to win. The math doesn’t seem to add up: The productivity growth slowdown we have experienced seems to be multiple times the size of the one that would have been expected from the redirection of investment from increasing productive capacity to environmental protection.\n",
    "Aside from the failure to measure the benefits of pollution control, the rest of the argument that the productivity growth slowdown can be explained by prob  lems of economic measurement is a bit too subtle to work. Few doubt that eco  nomic measurement entails big problems. These problems can reasonably be assumed to lead to significant understatements of the rate of economic growth. But to account for the productivity growth slowdown, the problems of measurement must have gotten worse. They must be much worse now than they were five decades ago. And how that can be true is not clear.\n",
    "The third proposed explanation of the productivity growth slowdown is that in the 1970s the baby-boom generation of Americans began to enter the labor force. This generation is very large. We should know: Brad was bom in 1960, the year in which more Americans were born than in any year either before or since. The relatively young labor force had many more workers with little experience than did the labor force of the 1960s and 1950s. Some economists argue that this fall in the average level of labor-force experience generated the productivity growth slowdown. Others point out that the baby-boom generation had little experience but a lot of education, and that in the past education had been a powerful booster of productivity. The average level of education in the labor force increased quite rapidly as the baby-boom gener  ation entered the economy. Once again, this is an unlikely full explanation: Entry of the baby boomers into the labor force may be part of the answer, but the combina  tion of their low experience and their high education makes it hard to sell the entry of the baby-boom generation as a large net reduction in labor-force quality.\n",
    "The last explanation of the productivity growth slowdown is the tripling of world oil prices by the OPEC cartel in 1973, in the wake of the third Arab-Israeli war. Pro  ductivity growth slowed at almost exactly the same time that oil prices skyrocketed. Economists hypothesized that in response to the tripling of world oil prices firms\n",
    "\n",
    " began redirecting their capital expenditures from capital that produced more out  put to capital that used less energy; firms retired a large share of their most energy- intensive capital and began to substitute workers for energy use wherever possible.\n",
    "The problem with this explanation is twofold. First, since 1986 real oil prices have been lower than they were before 1973; hence the productivity growth slow  down should have ended in the late 1980s, but it didn’t. Second, energy costs are not that large a share of the typical business’s costs. By the start of the 1990s the productivity growth slowdown had left America with real GDP levels about a quar  ter lower than they would have been had productivity growth continued at its pre- 1973 rate. How could even the tripling of the price of a commodity that accounts for less than 4 percent of costs lead to a more than 25 percent reduction in out  put? Thus it is hard to see the oil price increases of the 1970s as a full accounting.\n",
    "That an event as important as the productivity growth slowdown that started in the early 1970s remains so mysterious is extremely frustrating to economists. The causes of the productivity growth slowdown remain uncertain. The best theory combines all the others — the “a lot of different bad things happening all at once” theory. But it remains unsatisfactory.\n",
    "Effects of the Productivity Growth Slowdown\n",
    "At a productivity growth rate of 2.1 percent per year — the rate the United States enjoyed from 1950 to 1973 — output per worker doubles every 34 years. At the 1973-1995 growth rate of 0.6 percent per year, output per worker takes 120 years to double — three and a half times as long. Social psychologists tell us that 40-year- olds feel happiest not when their incomes are high but when their incomes are high relative to those of their households when they were growing up. Before 1973, when growth in output per worker was more rapid, most American voters felt much richer than their parents and hence were more willing to invest in social welfare programs and other liberal political initiatives. Between 1973 and 1995, slower growth made Americans feel much less well off than they had expected they would be.\n",
    "Economic growth slowed sharply as a result of the productivity growth slow  down. But whether economic growth stopped for large numbers of Americans is not clear. Box 5.2 analyzes what we know about the “true” pace of economic growth during the productivity growth slowdown. The consequences of this are uncertain: Former president Jimmy Carter saw it as the origin of a national “malaise.” Liberals have blamed it for a rightward shift in politics. American con  servatives have blamed it for a rush to security and an unwillingness to undertake bold libertarian experiments. All have seen it as a cause of more (not necessarily unjustified) skepticism toward the government and its programs.\n",
    "DID REAL STANDARDS OF LIVING DECLINE DURING THE SLOWDOWN PERIOD? THE DETAILS\n",
    "For some categories of workers (e.g., males in their twenties with less than a high- school diploma), the productivity growth slowdown of roughly 1973 to 1995 was accompanied by stagnant or declining measured real wages. Yet offsetting this are many improvements in quality of life — from cleaner air to the convenience of automated teller machines — that the national income accounting system cannot measure.\n",
    "If we accept the estimates of the mid-1980s Boskin Commission (chaired by economist Michael Boskin), we conclude that unmeasured growth in material well  being is greatly uncertain but somewhere around 1 percent per year. If this is\n",

    "correct, then true total product-per-worker growth in the United States has slowed not to the 0.6 percent per year recorded in official statistics for 1973-1995 but to 1.6 percent per year. This is still a substantial drop from the estimated 3.1 percent per year that the same adjustment produces for growth before 1973.\n",
    "And increased income inequality has produced declines in real income or near stagnation for some groups (see Figure 5.6). But it is not true that America’s output per worker stagnated for all workers over the two decades before 1995.

    "The U.S. economy has benefited from a stunning investment boom since 1992. Between 1992 and 1998 real GDP rose by an average of 3.6 percent per year, and business fixed investment soared at a 10.1 percent average rate, almost three times as fast. As a consequence, the share of business fixed investment in GDP jumped from 9.2 percent to 13.2 percent, with much of the additional invest  ment going into computers and related equipment. The consensus among econ  omists is that the recent acceleration in productivity growth resulted from this boom in real investment, a huge share of which was driven by the rapidly falling price of computers. According to the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Eco  nomic Analysis, the price of computing equipment fell by an average of 19 per  cent per year between 1990 and 2003. Each year the same nominal expenditure on computers bought 19 percent more in terms of real computer equipment.\n",
    "Consensus opinion was tipped into believing that the post-1995 reversal of the productivity growth slowdown was a durable phenomenon by the fact that pro  ductivity growth in America despite falling somewhat during the short business- cycle recession of 2001, continued to be quite rapid throughout the period of uneven business-cycle recovery that followed in 2002, and the faster period of recovery in 2003 and 2004 as shown in Figure 5.7. The normal business cycle\n",
    "\n",
    " 138 Chapter 5 The Reality of Economic Growth: History and Prospect\n",
    "pattern is for productivity growth to be slow — not fast — during a recession. This normal pattern did not hold, as businesses used investment in high-tech equip  ment to continue to boost their productivity even when the labor market was a buyer’s market.\n",
    "A rapidly falling price of capital goods has the same effect on total investment as a rapidly rising saving rate. We know that the higher is the share of national product devoted to saving and gross investment — the higher is s — the higher will be the economy’s balanced-growth capital-output ratio s/(n + g + 8). The same thing applies to falling prices of capital goods — in this case, the falling prices of information technology and communications equipment. Halve the price of capi  tal goods, and you will find that in the long run you have doubled the economy’s capital intensity — doubled its average ratio of capital to output — with important consequences for the level of output per worker.\n",
    "One way to think about it is that, as long as the technological revolution in information technology continues and the price of computers and related goods keeps falling at an astronomical rate, the United States is undergoing a new “great traverse” — only this time it is not to a growth path with a higher ratio of indus  trial capital like steel mills to output, but to a growth path with a higher ratio of information capital like computer chips to output.\n",
    "There is every reason to expect that technological progress in the computer and communications sectors will continue, and there is every reason to expect that these useful technologies will continue to diffuse throughout the economy. The best bet in forecasting future productivity growth is to make future projections on the basis of what has happened in the past half-decade. The productivity growth slowdown has been brought to an end by the technological revolution in comput  ers and communications. But that is a subject to be explored further toward the end of this book, in Chapter 16.\n",
    "RECAP MODERN AMERICAN ECONOMIC GROWTH\n",
    "Over the past two centuries measured economic growth in the United States has raised output per worker at an average pace of between 1.5 and 2.0 percent per year. Moreover, it is likely that true output-per-worker growth since 1890 has been even faster. Many economists believe that official estimates overstate infla  tion and understate real economic growth by 1.0 percent per year, in large part because national income accountants have a very hard time valuing the boost to productivity and standards of living generated by the invention of new goods and services, and new types of goods and services.\n",
    "Accompanying this increase in productivity and living standards is structural change: the move from the country to the city, the large-scale shift of employ  ment from agriculture to manufacturing and now to services, and the creation of large business organisations. Starting in 1973 the steady trend of climbing rates of productivity growth stopped cold: Between 1973 and 1995 measured growth in output per worker in the U.S. economy grew at only 0.6 percent per year. Since 1995, however, productivity growth in the American economy has accelerated once again to a pace of 2.7 percent per year, the result of an invest  ment boom, the rapidly falling prices of computers and communications equip  ment, and technological advances.\n",

    "The industrial core of the world economy saw its level of material productivity and standard of living explode in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Elsewhere the growth of productivity levels and standards of living and the spread of indus  trial technologies were slower. As the industrialized economies grew while indus  trial technologies spread slowly elsewhere, the world became a more and more unequal place. As development economist Lant Pritchett puts it, the dominant fea  ture of world economic history from the Industrial Revolution up until 1980 or so is “divergence, big time.” In terms of relative incomes and productivity levels, the world today is very unequal and very divergent, as Figure 5.8 shows.\n",
    "Those who live in relatively poor regions of the world today have higher mate  rial living standards than did their predecessors who lived in those regions a cen  tury ago. But the relative gap vis-a-vis the industrial core has grown extraordinar  ily and extravagantly. In the first half of the nineteenth century the average inhabitant of an average country had perhaps one-half the material standard of liv  ing of a citizen of the world’s leading industrial economy. Although the difficulties of making such comparisons are overwhelming (and Box 5.3 provides some insight into the difficulties of making such comparisons), our best estimate is that the aver  age inhabitant of an average country has only one-sixth the material standard of living and productivity level of a leading nation like the United States today.\n",
    "The Exception: OECD Economies\n",
    "Such divergence is not inevitable. The United States, with its perhaps 14- to 25-fold increase in output per worker over the years since 1870, has not been the fastest growing economy in the world. A number of other economies at different levels of industrialization, development, and material productivity a century ago have now con  verged, and their levels of productivity, economic structures, and standards of living today are very close to those of the United States (see Box 5.4). The six largest of these converging economies and the United States make up the so-called Group of Seven (G-7) economies. The six non-U.S. members’ steady process of convergence to the U.S. level from 1950 until about 2000 is shown in Figure 5.9 on page 142.\n",
    "Most of these economies were much poorer than the United States in 1870. Most were significantly poorer in 1950. The Japanese economy, for example, went from a level of output per capita equal to 16 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to 84 per  cent of the U.S. level in 1992 — before falling steeply backward during Japan’s recent recession. Italian levels of GDP per capita have gone from 30 to 65 percent of the U.S. level; German levels, from 40 to 75 percent; Canadian levels, from 70 to 85 percent; and British levels, from 60 to 70 percent in the past half-century.\n",
    "Moreover, much of the remaining differential between the United States and western Europe is the result of different institutions and tastes for leisure; for exam  ple, western Europeans take what many Americans would regard as extravagant vacations. Much of today’s differential between the United States and Japan is the result of deliberate political choice: Japan’s politicians have decided to keep their agriculture-based industries and their wholesale and retail distribution systems pro  tected from competition, small scale, and thus — from an American standpoint — inefficient.\n",

    " PURCHASING-POWER-PARITY AND REAL EXCHANGE RATE COMPARISONS: SOME TOOLS\n",
    "When our focus is on comparing standards of living, either across time or across countries, we get much more meaningful figures by correcting current (and even average trend) exchange rates for differences in purchasing power parity (PPP). The differences between estimates of relative income levels based on current exchange rates and estimates based on PPP calculations can be very large. On a purchasing- power-parity basis GDP per worker in the United States today is some 13 times GDP per worker in India; by contrast, on an average exchange rate basis GDP per worker in the United States today is more than 70 times the level in India.\n",
    "PPP-based calculations attempt (as the name implies) to translate one currency into another at a rate that preserves average purchasing power. But current exchange rates do not preserve purchasing power. If you exchange your dollars in the United States for rupees in India you will find that your rupees in India will buy about the same amount of internationally traded manufactured goods as your dollars would have bought in the United States. (Unless, of course, you try to buy something that the Indian government has decided to put up a trade barrier against.) But your rupees in India will buy you vastly more in the way of personal services, the products of skilled craftspeople, and any other labor-intensive goods and services.\n",
    "Why? International arbitrage keeps the exchange rate at the level that makes eas  ily traded manufactured goods roughly equally expensive. If they weren’t, someone could make an easy fortune by shipping them from where they were cheap to where they were dear. But how — in this world of stringent immigration restrictions — can a cook in Bangalore take advantage of the fact that there is fierce demand in Marin County, north of San Francisco, for caterers who can prepare a good curry? Because relative productivity levels in labor services are much more equal than rel  ative productivity levels in manufacturing, living standards throughout the world are more equal than exchange rate-based calculations suggest.\n",
    "WHY HAVE THESE ECONOMIES CONVERGED? A POLICY\n",
    "By and large the economies that have converged are those that belong to the Orga  nization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which was started shortly after World War II, in the days of the Marshall Plan, as a group of coun  tries that received (or gave) Marshall Plan aid to help rebuild and reconstruct after the war. Countries that received Marshall Plan aid adopted a common set of eco  nomic policies: large private sectors freed of government regulation of prices, investment with its direction determined by profit-seeking businesses, large social insurance systems to redistribute income, and governments committed to avoiding mass unemployment.\n",
    "The original OECD members all wound up with mixed economies. In these, mar  kets direct the flow of resources, while governments stabilize the economy, provide social insurance safety nets, and encourage entrepreneurship and enterprise. The member nations arrived at this setup largely due to good luck, partly due to the Cold War, and partly as a result of post-World War II institutional reforms.\n",

    " THE EAST ASIAN MIRACLE: POLICY\n",
    "The story of extraordinarily successful economies goes beyond the original OECD nations. The economies of the “east Asian miracle” have over the past two gener  ations exhibited stronger growth than has ever before been seen anywhere in the world. They have not yet converged to the standards of living and levels of eco  nomic productivity found in the world economy’s industrial core, but they are con  verging.\n",
    "Immediately before World War II the regions that are now South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan had output-per-worker levels less than one-tenth the level of the United States. Today Singapore’s GDP per capita is 90 percent, Hong Kong’s is 70 percent, Taiwan’s is 50 percent, and South Korea’s is 45 per  cent of the U.S. level. A second wave of east Asian economies — Malaysia and Thailand — now average more than one-quarter of the U.S. level of GDP per capita.\n",
    "The successful east Asian economies share a number of similarities with the OECD economies in terms of economic policy and structure. Resource alloca  tion decisions are by and large left to the market. Governments regard the encouragement of entrepreneurship and enterprise as a major goal. And high saving and investment rates are encouraged by a number of different govern  ment policies.\n",
    "Yet there are also a number of differences vis-a-vis the OECD. Governments in east Asia have been more aggressive in pursuing industrial policy and somewhat less aggressive in establishing social insurance systems than have the OECD economies. However, they have also had more egalitarian income distributions and hence less need for redistribution and social insurance. They have subsidized cor  porations that they believe are strategic for economic development, thinking that their bureaucrats know better than the market — heresy to economists. (However, it is worth noting that they have focused subsidies on the companies that have proved successful at exporting goods to other countries, so their bureaucrats have in a sense been rewarding the judgment of foreign markets.) The examples of suc  cessful catching up suggest that growth could have been faster in the world econ  omy. Economies — even very poor ones — can rapidly adopt modern machine technologies and move their productivity levels close to first-world leading-edge standards.\n",

On the other side were regimes that claimed, in the 1946-1989 Cold War, to be of the “free world”— regimes that were, if not good, at least less bad. Walk this geographic line from Poland to Korea and then hop over to the only Western hemisphere communist satellite, Cuba, looking first at the level of material welfare in the communist countries and then at the level of material welfare in the noncommunist countries. The location of the Iron Curtain is a historical accident: It is where Stalin’s Russian armies stopped after World War II, where Mao’s Chinese armies stopped in the early 1950s, and where Giap’s Vietnamese armies stopped in the mid-1970s.\n",

    "Notice as you walk that outside the Iron Curtain, the countries are far better off in terms of GDP per capita (see Table 5.4). They are not necessarily better off in education, health care, or the degree of income inequality. If you were in the poorer half of the population, you probably received a better education and had access to better medical care in Cuba than in Mexico. But the countries fortunate enough to lie outside what was the Iron Curtain were and are vastly more pros  perous. Depending on how you count and how unlucky you are, between 40 and 94 percent of the potential material prosperity of a country was annihilated if it happened to fall under communist rule in the twentieth century. The fact that a large part of the globe was under communist rule in the twentieth century is one major reason for the world’s divergence. A failure to successfully aid postcommu  nist economies in their transition would be a further blow, and, as Box 5.6 dis  cusses, “transition” is not going well.\n",
    "The Rule: Divergence in General\n",
    "Even if attention is confined to non-communist-ruled economies, there still has been enormous divergence in relative output-per-worker levels over the past 100 years. Since 1870, the ratio of richest to poorest economies has increased sixfold. In 1870 two-thirds of all countries had GDP-per-capita levels between 60 and 160 percent of the average. Today the range that includes two-thirds of all countries extends from 35 to 280 percent of the average.\n",
    "There is reason to hope that the era of widening world income and productiv  ity gaps is over. China for the past 25 and India for the past 20 years have begun to grow much faster than before, and to begin the process of catching up to the world’s industrial leaders. Together they are home to nearly 40 percent of the human race.\n",

    " POSTCOMMUNISM: POLICY\n",
    "The demolition of the Berlin Wall and the elimination of the Iron Curtain have not significantly improved the situation in what are euphemistically and opti  mistically called “economies in transition” (from socialism to capitalism, that is). Figuring out how to move from a stagnant, ex-communist economy to a dynamic, growing one is very difficult, and no one has ever done it before.\n",
    "A few of the economies in transition appear to be on the path toward rapid con  vergence with western Europe: Slovenia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland have already successfully maneuvered through enough of the transition phase to have advanced their economies beyond the point reached before 1989. It seems clear that their economic destiny is to become, effectively, part of western Europe. Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia appear to have good prospects of follow  ing their example.\n",
    "Elsewhere, however, the news is bad. Whether reforms have taken place step-by- step or all at once, whether ex-communists have been excluded from or have dom  inated the government, and whether governments have been nationalist or interna  tionalist, the results have been similar. Output has fallen, corruption has been rife, and growth has not resumed. Material standards of living in Ukraine today are less than half of what they were when General Secretary Gorbachev ruled from Moscow.\n",
    "Economists debate ferociously the appropriate economic strategy for unwinding the inefficient centrally planned Soviet-style economy. The fact that such a transi  tion has never been undertaken before should make advice givers cautious. And one other observation should make advice givers depressed: The best predictor of whether an eastern European country’s transition will be rapid and successful or not appears to be its distance from western European political and financial capi  tals like Vienna, Frankfurt, and Stockholm.\n",
    "Sources of Divergence\n",
    "The principal cause of the extraordinary variation in output per worker between countries today is differences in their respective equilibrium capital-output ratios. Two secondary causes are, first, openness to creating and adapting the technolo  gies that enhance the efficiency of labor as measured by levels of development two generations ago and, second, the level of education today.\n",
    "Productivity two generations ago is a good indicator of the level of technolog  ical knowledge that had been acquired as of a half-century ago. The level of edu  cation today captures the country’s ability to invent and acquire further techno  logical expertise today. Without education, inventing new and adopting foreign technological knowledge are simply not possible.\n",
    "Global Patterns\n",
    "Together these factors — the determinants of capital intensity (the capital-output ratio) and the two determinants of access to technology — account for the bulk of the differences between countries in their relative productivity levels.\n",
    "The determinants of the equilibrium capital-output ratio play a very powerful role. A higher share of investment in national product is powerfully correlated with relative levels of output per worker. No country with an investment rate of less than 10 percent has an output-per-worker level even 20 percent that of the United\n",

    "States. No country with an investment share of less than 20 percent has an output- per-worker level greater than 75 percent of the U.S. level.\n",
    "A high level of labor-force growth is correlated, albeit less powerfully, with a low level of output per worker. The average country with a labor-force growth rate of more than 3 percent per year has an output-per-worker level of less than 20 per  cent of the U.S. level. The average country with a labor-force growth rate of less than 1 percent has an output-per-worker level that is greater than 60 percent of the U.S. level.\n",
    "Together these determinants of the equilibrium capital-output ratio can, statis  tically, account for up to half of the variation in national economies’ levels of pro  ductivity per worker in the world today. The power of these factors is central to the theoretical model of economic growth presented in Chapter 4 and should not be underestimated. Indeed, their power is the reason we spent so much space on the standard growth model in Chapter 4.\n",
    "But the factors stressed in Chapter 4 are not the only major determinants of rel  ative wealth and poverty in the world today. Differences in the efficiency of labor are as important as differences in equilibrium capital-output ratios. Differences in the efficiency of labor arise from the differential ability of workers to handle and utilize modern technologies. The efficiency of labor is high where education lev  els are high — so workers can use the modern technologies they are exposed to — and where economic contact with the industrial core is high — so workers and managers are exposed to the modern technologies invented in the world’s R&D laboratories.\n",
    "Schooling is the variable that has the strongest correlation with output per worker. Countries that have an average of four to six years of schooling have output- per-worker levels that average 20 percent of the U.S. level. Those with an average level of schooling of more than 10 years have output-per-worker levels of 65 per  cent of the U.S. level, as Figure 5.10 shows.\n",
    "No single best indicator exists of a country’s exposure to — and thus ability to adopt and adapt — the technologies invented in the industrial core that amplify the efficiency of labor. Some economists focus on trade and foreign investment as the main sources of increased efficiency and technological capability. Others focus on geographic and climatic factors that have influenced migration and still influ  ence trade and intellectual exchange. Still others focus on institutions of gover  nance and their effect on entrepreneurship as the key variable. But as much as economists dispute which variables are most important as determinants of tech- nology transfer and the efficiency of labor, all agree that all these variables are important indeed to understanding why our world today is the way it is.\n",
    "Cause and Effect, Effect and Cause\n",
    "All the factors discussed are both causes and effects. High population growth and low levels of output per worker go together both because rapid population growth reduces the equilibrium capital-output ratio and because poor countries have not yet undergone their demographic transitions. This interaction — in which a high rate of population growth reduces the equilibrium capital-output ratio and a low equilibrium capital-output ratio means that the demographic transition is not far advanced — creates a vicious spiral that reinforces relative poverty.\n",
    "Moreover, demography is not the only vicious spiral potentially present. A poor country must pay a high relative price for the capital equipment it needs to acquire in order to turn its saving into productive additions to its capital stock. This should\n",

    "come as no surprise. The world’s most industrialized and prosperous economies are the most industrialized and prosperous because they have attained very high levels of manufacturing productivity: Their productivity advantage in unskilled service industries is much lower than that in capital- and technology-intensive manufac  tured goods. The higher relative price of machinery in developing countries means that poor countries get less investment — a smaller share of total investment in real GDP — out of any given effort at saving some fixed share of their incomes.\n",
    "Moreover, to the extent that education is an important kind of investment, a good education is much harder to provide in a poorer country. Even primary edu  cation requires at its base a teacher, some books, and a classroom — things that are relatively cheap and easy for a rich country to provide but expensive for a poor country. In western Kenya today the average primary school classroom has 0.4 book per pupil.\n",
    "But virtuous circles are also possible. Anything that increases productivity and sets the demographic transition in motion will reduce the rate of growth of the labor force, increase the amount of investment bought by any given amount of sav  ing, and make education easier.\n",
    "How important are these vicious spirals and virtuous circles? It is hard to look at the cross-country pattern of growth over the past century without thinking that such vicious spirals and virtuous circles must have been very important. Other  wise, the massive divergence in relative productivity levels seems inexplicable.\n",

Consider Argentina once again, for it has been one of the world’s most disappointing performers in terms of economic growth in the twentieth century. Argentina has experienced substantial economic growth. Offi  cially measured labor productivity or national product per capita in Argentina today is perhaps three times what it was in 1900. True productivity, taking adequate account of the value of new commodities, is higher. But the much more smoothly running engine of capitalist development in Norway — no more, and probably less, rich and productive than Argentina in 1900 — has multiplied measured national product per capita there by a factor of 9.\n",
    "A pattern of productivity growth like Argentina’s is heartbreakingly slow when compared to what, reasonably, might have been and was achieved by the world’s industrial leaders. What is bad about falling behind, or falling further behind, is not that second place is a bad place to be — it is false to think that the only thing that matters is to be top nation and that it is better to be poor but first than rich but second. What is bad about falling behind is that the world’s industrial leaders provide an easily viewable benchmark of how things might have been different and of how much better things might have been. There was no destiny keeping Buenos Aires today from looking like and having its people as rich as those of Paris, Toronto, or Sydney.\n",
    "Half Empty and Half Full\n",

    "\n",
    " where they are dear. As they travel with increasing speed and increasing volume as transportation and communication costs fall, these commodity and factor-of- production flows should erode differences in productivity and living standards between national economies. Moreover, most of the edge in standards of living and productivity levels held by the industrial core is no one’s private property but, instead, is the common intellectual and scientific heritage of humankind. Hence every poor economy has an excellent opportunity to catch up with the rich by adopting and adapting from this open storehouse of modern machine technology.\n",
    "We can view this particular glass either as half empty or as half full. Half full is that much of the world has already made the transition to sustained economic growth. Most people today live in economies that, while far poorer than the leading- edge postindustrial nations of the world’s economic core, have successfully climbed onto the escalator of economic growth and thus the escalator to modernity. The eco  nomic transformation of most of the world is less than a century behind that of the leading-edge economies — only an eyeblink behind from the perspective of the six millennia since the spread of agriculture out of the Middle East’s fertile crescent.\n",
    "Moreover, perhaps we can look forward to a future in which convergence of rel  ative income levels will finally begin to take place. The bulk of humanity is now achieving material standards of living at which the demographic transition takes hold. As population growth rates in developing countries fall, their capital-output ratios will begin to rise quickly. With tolerable government, reasonable security of property, and better ways of achieving an education, their output-per-worker lev  els and material standards of living will converge to the world’s leading edge.\n",
    "Half empty is that we live today in the most unequal age — in terms of the diver  gence in the life prospects of children born into different economies — that the world has ever seen. One and a half billion people today live in economies that have not made the transition to intensive economic growth and have not climbed onto the escalator to modernity.

Government deficits also have the potential to reduce the saving rate: Unless consumers and investors are farsighted enough to recog  nize that a government deficit now means a tax increase later, a government that spends more than it raises in revenue must borrow — and the amount borrowed is not a contribution to total national saving because it is not available to fund investment.\n",

    "decade or a generation off the time needed to industrialize — if the foreign-funded capital is used wisely. Free-trade policies that allow businesses to freely earn and spend the foreign exchange they need to purchase new generations of machinery and equipment are an effective way of boosting investment. Policies that impose heavy tariffs or require scarce import licenses in order to purchase foreign-made capital equipment are a sure sign that a country will not get its money’s worth out of a given nominal savings share but will, instead, find that real investment remains low. Indeed, many of the most successful developing states have done the oppo  site. They have provided large subsidies to fund investment and expansion by busi  nesses that have demonstrated their competence and productivity by successfully exporting and thus competing in the world market.\n",
    "Education\n",
    "Universal education, especially of girls, pays a twofold benefit. Investments are more likely to be productive with a better educated workforce to draw on; hence investments are more likely to be made. Educated women are likely to want at least as much education for their children as they had, and they are likely to have relatively attractive opportunities outside the home, so the birthrate is likely to fall.\n",
    "The developing countries of the world appear, for the most part, to be going through the demographic transition faster than the economies of today’s industrial core did in the past three centuries. Thus current estimates of the world’s popula  tion in 2050 are markedly lower than the estimates of a decade ago. Ten years ago the projected global population in 2050 was 16 billion or more; today it is 12 bil  lion or less. This is due, in part at least, to rapid expansions in educational attain  ment in today’s developing economies.\n",
    "A high level of educational attainment also raises the efficiency of labor both by teaching skills directly and by making it easier to advance the general level of tech  nological expertise. A leading-edge economy with a high level of educational attain  ment is likely to have more inventions. A follower economy with a high level of educational attainment is likely to have a more successful time at adapting to local conditions the inventions and innovations from the industrial core of the world economy. How large these effects are at the macroeconomic level is uncertain, but that they are there nobody doubts.\n",
    "The east Asian economies, especially, provide examples of how uncorrupt and well-managed developing states can follow macroeconomic policies that accelerate economic growth and convergence. These economies, which have provided incen  tives to accelerate the demographic transition and boost saving and investment, have managed to close the gap vis-a-vis the world economy’s industrial core faster than anyone would have believed possible.\n",
    "Policies for Technological Advance\n",
    "Without better technology, increases in capital stock produced by investment rap  idly run into diminishing returns. And without improvements in the “technolo  gies” of organization, government, and education, productivity stagnates.\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, economists have relatively little to say about what governs technological progress. Why did better technology raise living standards by 2 percent annually two generations ago but by less than 1 percent during the subsequent two decades? Why did technology progress by only 0.25 percent per year in the early 1800s? Improving literacy, communications, and research and\n",
    "\n",
    " development may help explain faster progress since the Industrial Revolution than before it and faster progress in the twentieth than in the nineteenth century. Yet, as noted above, as important a feature of recent economic history as the 1973-1995 productivity growth slowdown remains largely a mystery.\n",
    "Invention and Innovation\n",
    "Economists note that technological progress has two components: science (solid- state physics and the invention of the transistor, the mapping of the human genome, the discovery that potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal when mixed together and exposed to heat have interesting properties) and research and development that lead to successful innovation. About pure science economists have almost nothing to say. About research and development, and the innovations it generates, economists have rather more to say.\n",
    "Economists note that perhaps 75 percent of all U.S. scientists and engineers work on research and development for private firms. R&D spending amounts to about 3 percent of GDP in the United States and other advanced industrial economies. One-fifth of total gross investment is research and development. More than half of net investment is research and development — investments in knowl  edge, as opposed to investments in machinery, equipment, structures, and infra  structure.\n",
    "Businesses conduct investments in R&D to increase their profits. Firms spend money on R&D for reasons analogous to those that lead them to expand their capac  ity or improve their factories. If the expected present value of profits from an R&D project at the prevailing rate is greater than the costs of the project, then the busi  ness will spend money on the project. If not, then it will not.\n",
    "Rivalry and Excludability\n",
    "But some features of technology make thinking about the R&D process more complicated than thinking about other types of investment. First and most important, research and development is a public good. A firm that has discovered something — a new and more profitable process, a new and better way of organ  izing the factory, a new type of commodity that can be produced — will not reap the entire social benefit from its discovery. Other businesses can examine the innovation — the product, the process, the method of organization — and copy it. They can probably do so for a much lower cost than was needed to research and develop the innovation in the first place.\n",
    "By contrast, a firm that has just spent a large sum to buy and move into a new building does not have to worry that any other firm will use that building as well. As a commodity, a building — or a machine, or even the skills and experience inside a worker’s head — is both rival and excludable. To say that a commodity is rival means that if one firm is using it, another firm cannot do so: I cannot use that hammer to pound this nail if you are now using it to pound that other nail. To say that a commodity is excludable means that the uowner” of the commodity can easily monitor who is using it and can easily keep those whom he or she does not authorize from using it.\n",
    "Most physical commodities are (or, with the assistance of the legal system, can easily be made) both rival and excludable. But by their nature ideas are not. Ideas are definitely not rival — nothing in the physical universe makes it impossible for me to use the same idea you are using. And ideas are hard to make excludable as well: How can you keep me from thinking what I want to think?\n",

    "patent laws and copyrights\n",
    "Laws designed to encourage invention and innovation\n",
    "by providing the right to exclude anyone else from using a discovery (patent)\n",
    "or intellectual property (copyright) for a period of years.\n",
    "Patents and Copyrights\n",
    "To protect ideas and intellectual property in general, countries have patent laws and copyrights. In fact, one of the few enumerated powers that the U.S. Consti  tution gives Congress is the power to set up limited-term patent and copyright laws. Patents give a firm that has discovered something new the right to exclude anyone else from using that discovery for a period of years. But even the strictest patent and copyright laws are incomplete. Often the most valuable part of the R&D process is figuring out not how to do something but whether it (or something very close to it) can be done at all. Once a patent has been granted, other firms can and do search for alternative ways of making it or ways of making something close to it that are not covered by the patent.\n",
    "Governments seeking to establish patent laws face a difficult dilemma. If their patent laws are strong, then much of the modern technology in the economy will be restricted in use. Technology may be restricted to being used only by the inven  tor or restricted because the inventor is allowed to charge other firms high licens  ing fees to use it (or to not let them use it at all). Letting everyone use the idea or the process or the innovation, once it is discovered, entails no social cost. Infor  mation, after all, wants to be free. Thus a government that enacts strict patent laws is pushing the average level of technology used in its factories and businesses at some particular moment far below the level that could be achieved at that partic  ular moment.\n",
    "On the other hand, if the patent laws are weak and thus provide little protec  tion to inventors and innovators, then the profits that inventors and innovators earn will be low. Why then should businesses devote money and resources to research and development? They will not. And the pace of innovation, and thus of technological improvement, will slow to a crawl.\n",
    "This dilemma cannot be evaded. The profits from innovation derive from the innovator’s monopoly right to the innovation — and hence the rest of the econ  omy is excluded from using that item of technology. Reduce the degree of exclu  sion to lower the deadweight loss from using less-than-best-practice technology, and you will End that you have reduced the rewards to research and development (and thus presumably the pace of R&D as well). Increase the strength of the patent system to raise the rewards to research and development, and you will End that you have increased the gap between the average technology used in the economy and the feasible best practice.\n",
    "Moreover, technological progress depends on more than the appropriability of research — the extent to which the increased productivity made possible by inno  vation boosts the profits of the innovating firm. It also depends on the productiv  ity of research: How much in the way of new productivity-enhancing inventions is produced by a given investment in R&D? Economists don’t know much about the interactions among product development, applied research, and basic research, so they have little to say about how to improve the productivity of research and the pace of productivity growth.\n",
    "Government Failure\n",
    "That governments can assist in growth and development does not mean that gov  ernments will. The broad experience of growth in developing economies — outside the Asian Pacific Rim, outside the OECD — has been that governments often won’t.\n",
    "\n",
    " Over the past two decades many have argued that typical systems of regulation in developing countries have retarded development by\n",
    "• Embarking on “prestige” industrialization programs that keep resources from\n",
    "shifting to activities in which the country has a long-run comparative\n",
    "advantage.\n",
    "• Inducing firms and entrepreneurs to devote their energies to seeking rents by\n",
    "lobbying governments, instead of seeking profits by lowering costs.\n",
    "• Creating systems of regulation and project approval that have degenerated\n",
    "into extortion machines for manufacturing bribes for the bureaucrats.\n",
    "Many governments — particularly unelected governments — are not that interested in economic development. Giving valuable industrial franchises to the nephews of the dictator; making sure that members of your ethnic group are in key places to extort bribes; or taking the foreign exchange that would have been spent import  ing productive machinery and equipment and using it instead to buy more mod  ern weapons for the army — these can seem more attractive options. In the absence of political democracy, the checks on a government that does not seek economic development are few.\n",
    "Moreover, checks on government that do exist may not be helpful. In a non  democracy, or a shaky semidemocracy, government faces two possible sources of pressure: riots in the capital and coups by the soldiers. Even a government that seeks only the best for its people in terms of economic growth will have to deal with these sources of pressure and will have to avoid riots in the capital and coups by the soldiers.\n",
    "Riots in the capital are best avoided by making sure that the price of food is low and that influential opinion leaders in the capital are relatively happy with their material standards of living. Coups by the soldiers are best avoided by spending money on the military. Thus governments find themselves driven to poli  cies that redistribute income from the farms to the cities, from exporting businesses to urban consumers of imported goods, from those who have the power to invest and make the economy grow to those who have the power to overthrow the government.\n",
    "If the rulers have the worst of motives, government degenerates into kleptoc- racy: rule by the thieves. If government has the best of motives, it is still hard to avoid policies that diminish saving and retard the ability to translate saving into productive investment. W. W. Rostow recounts a visit by President Kennedy to Indonesia in the early 1960s; Kennedy talked about economic development and a South Asian Development Bank to provide capital for Indonesia’s economic growth. Indonesia’s then-dictator, Sukarno, responded, “Mr. President, development takes too long. Give me West Irian [province, the western half of the island of New Guinea, to annex] instead.”\n",
    "Taken as a group, the poor countries of the world have not closed any of the gap relative to the world’s industrial leaders since World War II.\n",
    "Neoliberalism\n",

The government has a sphere of core competencies — administration of justice, maintenance of macroeconomic stability, avoidance of deep recessions, some\n",

    "Chapter Summary\n",
    "1. Before the commercial revolution (1500 or so) eco  nomic growth was very slow. Populations grew at a glacial pace. And as best we can tell there were no sig  nificant increases in standards of living for millennia before 1500: Humanity was caught in a Malthusian trap.\n",
    "2. The way out of the Malthusian trap opened about 1500. Thereafter populations grew, and standards of living and levels of material productivity grew as well.\n",
    "3. The Industrial Revolution was the start of the current epoch: the epoch of modern economic growth. Begin  ning in the mid-eighteenth century the pace of inven  tion and innovation ratcheted up. Key inventions\n",
    "replaced muscle with machine power, and material pro  ductivity levels boomed.\n",
    "4. Modem economic growth is well described by the growth model in Chapter 4, which is why we spent so much time on it. Output per worker and capital per worker increase at a pace measured in percent per year, a pace that is ex  traordinarily rapid in long-term historical perspective.\n",
    "5. Productivity growth rates slowed down worldwide after 1973, causing living standards to rise more slowly in the 1970s and 1980s than they otherwise would have. Sev  eral explanations have been offered for the productivity growth slowdown, but economists generally agree the causes remain a mystery.\n",
    "infrastructure development, provision of social insurance — at which it is effec  tive. But there is a large area of potential activities in which governments (or, at least, governments that do not have the bureaucratic honesty and efficiency needed for a successful developing state) are more likely to be destructive than constructive, hence the neoliberal recommendation that governments attempt to shrink their role back to their core competencies and thus to deregulate indus  tries and privatize public enterprises. Whether such policies will in fact lead to convergence rather than continued divergence is still an open question.\n",
    "RECAP POLICIES AND LONG-RUN GROWTH\n",
    "Most people today live in economies that, while far poorer than the leading- edge postindustrial nations of the world’s economic core, have successfully climbed onto the escalator of economic growth and thus the escalator to modernity. A follower economy with a higher level of educational attainment is likely to have a much more successful time at adapting to local conditions inventions and innovations from the industrial core of the world economy. Thus education appears to be a key policy for successful economic growth out  side the industrial core. Inside the industrial core, without better technology increases in the capital stock produced by investment rapidly run into dimin  ishing returns. One-fifth of total gross investment is research and development. More than half of net investment is research and development — investment in knowledge, as opposed to investment in machinery, equipment, structures, and infrastructure.\n",
