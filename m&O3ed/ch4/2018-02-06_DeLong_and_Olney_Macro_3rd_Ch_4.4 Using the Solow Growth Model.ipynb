    "\n",
    "Real-world economies exhibit profound shifts in labor-force growth. The average woman in India today has only half the number of children that the average woman in India had only half a century ago. The U.S. labor force in the early eighteenth century grew at nearly 3 percent per year, doubling every 24 years. Today the U.S. labor force grows at 1 percent per year. Changes in the level of prosperity, changes in the freedom of migration, changes in the status of women that open up new categories of jobs to them (Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor could not get a private-sector legal job in San Francisco when she graduated from Stanford Law School even with her amazingly high class rank), changes in the average age of marriage or the availability of birth control that change fertility—all of these have powerful effects on economies’ rates of labor-force growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "What effects do such changes have on output per worker Y/L—on our mea sure of material prosperity? The faster the growth rate of the labor force n, the lower will be the economy’s balanced-growth capital-output ratio s/(n + g - δ). Why? Because each new worker who joins the labor force must be equipped with enough capital to be productive and to, on average, match the productivity of his or her peers. The faster the rate of growth of the labor force, the larger the share of current investment that must go to equip new members of the labor force with the capital they need to be productive. Thus the lower will be the amount of invest  ment that can be devoted to building up the average ratio of capital to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sudden and permanent increase in the rate of growth of the labor force will lower the level of output per worker on the balanced-growth path. How large will the long-run change in the level of output be, relative to what would have happened had labor-force growth not increased? It is straightforward to calculate if we know the other parameter values, as is shown in Box 4.4.1.\n",

    "Yes, a positive in the efficiency of labor growth g does reduce the economy’s balanced-growth path capital-output ratio. But these effects are overwhelmed by the more direct effect ofa larger g on output per worker. It is the economy with a high rate of efficiency of labor force growth g that becomes by far the richest over time. This is our most important conclusion. In the very longest run, the growth rate of the standard of living—of output per worker—can change if and only if the growth rate of labor efficiency changes. Other factors—a higher saving-investment rate, lower labor-force growth rate, or lower depreciation rate—can and down. But their effects are short and medium effects: They do not permanently change the growth rate of output per worker, because after the economy has converged to its balanced growth path the only determinant of the growth rate of output per worker is the growth rate of labor efficiency: both are equal to g.\n",

    "\n",
    "Shifts in labor force growth rates do happen: changes in immigration policy, the coming of cheap and easy contraception (or, earlier, widespread female literacy), or increased prosperity and expected prosperity that trigger \"baby booms\" can all have powerful and persistent effects on labor force growth down the pike. Shifts in the growth of labor efficiency growth happen as well: economic policy disasters and triumphs, countless forecasted \"new economies\" and \"secular stagnations\", and the huge economic shocks that were the first and second Industrial Revolutions—the latter inaugurating that global era of previously unimagined increasing prosperity we call modern economic growth—push an economy's labor efficiency growth rate g up or down and keep it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the most frequent sources of shifts in the parameters of the Solow growth model are shifts in the economy’s saving-investment rate. The rise of politicians eager to promise goodies—whether new spending programs or tax cuts — to voters induces large government budget deficits, which can be a persistent drag on an economy’s saving rate and its rate of capital accumulation. Foreigners become alternately overoptimistic and overpessimistic about the value of investing in our country, and so either foreign saving adds to or foreign capital flight reduces our own saving- investment rate. Changes in households’ fears of future economic disaster, in households’ access to credit, or in any of numerous other factors change the share of household income that is saved and invested. Changes in government tax policy may push after-tax returns up enough to call forth additional savings, or down enough to make savings seem next to pointless. Plus rational or irrational changes in optimism or pessimism—what John Maynard Keynes labelled the \"animal spirits\" of individual entrepreneurs, individual financiers, or bureaucratic committees in firms or banks or funds all can and do push an economy's savings-investment rate up and down.\n",

Because more investment increases the amount of new capital that can be devoted to building up the average ratio of cap  ital to output. Double the share of national product spent on gross investment, and you will find that you have doubled the economy’s capital intensity, or its average ratio of capital to output.\n",

The savings effort of society is simply sY, the amount of total output devoted to saving and investment. The investment requirements are the amount of new capital needed to replace depreciated and worn-out machines and buildings, plus the amount needed to equip new workers who increase the labor force, plus the amount needed to keep the stock of tools and machines at the disposal of more efficient workers increasing at the same rate as the efficiency of their labor. \n",

Unless the production function has very little in the way of diminishing returns—unless the parameter α is high—shifts in the growth rate of the efficiency of labor have the most powerful effects on the long-rund estiny in the economy: They change the long-run growth rate of the economy. Shifts in other parameters affect the economy’s capital intensity; affect what multiple of the efficiency of labor the balanced-growth path of output per worker follows, and make the economy richer or poorer as it con  verges to a new, different balanced-growth path.

    "1. One principal force driving long-run growth in output per worker is the set of improvements in the efficiency of labor springing from technological progress and ad  vances in organization.\n",
    "2. A second principal force driving long-run growth in output per worker is the increases in capital intensity, the ratio of the capital stock to output.\n",
    "3. The balanced-growth equilibrium in the Solow growth model occurs when the capital output ratio K/Y is con  stant. When K/Y is constant, the capital stock and real output are growing at the same rate.\n",
    "4. The Cobb-Douglas production function we use is\n",
    "This function is equivalent to\n",
    "An increase in the returns-to-investment parameter a makes the production function steeper. An increase in la  bor efficiency E makes the production function shift up.\n",
    "5. In equilibrium, investment equals saving: I = S = SH 4- SG + SF We assume S/Y, the saving-investment rate s, is constant.\n",
    "6. The balanced-growth equilibrium value of the capital output ratio K/Y is a constant equal to the saving rate s divided by the sum of the labor-force growth rate n, the labor efficiency growth rate g, and the depreciation rate 8: in balanced-growth equilibrium, K /Y = s/(n + g + 8).\n",
    "7. If the economy’s actual value of K/Y is initially greater than s/(n + g + 5), then K/Y will fall until it reaches its equilibrium value. If the economy’s actual value of K/Y is initially less than s/(n + g 4- 5), then K/Y will rise until it reaches its equilibrium value. It can take decades or generations for K/Y to reach its balanced-growth equilibrium value.\n",
    "8. An increase in the saving rate s, a decrease in the labor- force growth rate n, or a decrease in the depreciation rate 8 increases output per worker Y/L. The growth rate of Y/L will accelerate as the economy moves to its new higher balanced-growth path. But once the economy is on its new balanced-growth path, output per worker will grow at the same rate as it did initially.\n",
    "9. In balanced-growth equilibrium, the growth rate of out  put per worker equals the growth rate of labor efficiency g. So only an increase in the rate at which labor efficiency grows can produce a lasting increase in the rate of growth of output per worker.\n",
